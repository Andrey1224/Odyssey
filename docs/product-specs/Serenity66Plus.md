Model description
Serenity 66 Plus solves one of the main seated-bath pain points: waiting while the tub fills. With the Dual Flow system, you can immediately use the shower handset and stay warm. The hydrotherapy jets turn daily bathing into a light physiotherapy session, especially useful for back and joint discomfort.

Like the rest of the range, this bath has a zero-height threshold, making it ideal for people who struggle to lift their legs. The compact 660 mm width allows installation in most standard UK bathrooms without major remodeling.

Model description
Serenity 66 Special is built for customers who do not want compromises. The zero-height threshold keeps entry and exit as safe as possible, while the internal equipment is aligned with premium SPA standards.

Microbubble technology is the model's signature benefit: bubbles are fine enough to reach pores, helping remove impurities and dead skin. The heated seat solves the common discomfort of sitting in a cold bath while waiting for water. At only 660 mm wide, it still fits well in standard UK layouts.

Technical data (Specifications)
Width: 660 mm.

Weight capacity: 200 kg (35 stone).

Warranty: Lifetime on seal, 6 years on shell, 1 year on electronics and pumps.

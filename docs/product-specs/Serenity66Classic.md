Model description
The standout feature of the Serenity 66 Classic is its zero-height threshold. This means users do not need to step over a high rim: they can sit down first and then bring their legs inside. That significantly reduces fall risk.

The bath is exceptionally robust thanks to its stainless steel frame, rated up to 200 kg (35 stone). This is why it is often nicknamed "The Tank." The acrylic shell is resistant to chemicals and daily wear. The door can be removed in about five minutes (by undoing six nuts), making installation easier in homes with narrow doorways.

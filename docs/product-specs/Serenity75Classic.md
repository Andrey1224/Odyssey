Model description
The key difference in Serenity 75 Classic is its 750 mm width. This gives users more room to maneuver and improves in-bath comfort. The model also features one of the widest door openings on the market (850 mm), making transfers from mobility aids easier.

The design keeps the zero-height threshold concept, removing the need to step over a rim. As with the compact version, the door can be removed in about five minutes for servicing or easier transport through narrow internal doors. With its steel frame, this bath remains one of the toughest options in its category.

What is a walk-in shower bath?
A walk-in shower bath is a versatile "2-in-1" solution that combines the best of both worlds: a relaxing, full-length soak and a quick, convenient shower. Designed with safety for the whole family in mind, these baths feature a watertight door with a low threshold entry, making stepping in and out safe and effortless.

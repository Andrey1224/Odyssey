Model description

Larimar is made for customers who value both design and safety. The low-threshold entry significantly reduces the risk associated with high-rim conventional baths. The bath is UK-made from durable gel coat with a comfortable, easy-clean finish.

The L-shape supports both full bathing and everyday shower use. The inward-opening door helps maintain sealing performance under water pressure and saves external clearance space in the bathroom.

Model description
Maestro stands out due to its bi-fold door. In tight spaces, users do not need to force themselves into position to close the door; it folds smoothly without interfering with leg placement. As with Affinity, the door can be removed quickly for easier cleaning.

The bath uses premium gel-coat material for a smooth, durable, easy-maintenance surface. Despite its compact size, Maestro supports optional wellness upgrades such as air massage and chromotherapy.

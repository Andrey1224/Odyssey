What is a deep soaker bath?
A deep soaker bath is a tall, tub-style bathtub designed to allow the user to soak in a comfortable, upright sitting position. It is the ideal solution for those who want the therapeutic benefits of a deep soak but have difficulty using a traditional full-length bath.


Deep Immersion (extra depth allows for full-body soaking while seated) 


Space-Saving Design (compact footprint fits into small bathrooms where a standard bath won't) 


Integrated Comfort Seat (contoured internal seating provides stability and ease of access) 


Safety-First Entry (features wide-opening doors and low-step thresholds to reduce fall risks) 


Advanced Hydrotherapy (options for air massage, heated seats, and microbubble skin treatment)

Model description
The key advantage of Affinity is its bi-fold door. This design allows knees to remain in a comfortable position while the door is being closed, which is uncommon in this category. It is built for users who need a clear, unobstructed access path.

The shell material is high-grade gel coat: durable, chip-resistant, and non-porous, helping protect against stains, mold, and mildew. Seat and backrest geometry are shaped for natural support and comfort.

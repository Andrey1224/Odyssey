Model description
Stamford 75 Classic is often chosen for highly accessible bathrooms because its door mechanism is optimized for users with limited mobility. The inward swing path is engineered to pass above the knees of a seated user, making door closure easier once inside.

The build is very durable: steel frame plus reinforced fiberglass support up to 200 kg. The acrylic finish is resistant to wear and cleaning chemicals, easy to maintain, and color-stable over time. Despite its rugged construction, Stamford maintains a clean modern look.
